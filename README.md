### Project Vision

The Opportunity Contact Roles team is concerned with planning for the future of Opportunity Contact Roles now that they're a full object. We seek to share knowledge about the current (new and improved) state of the object, and next steps for migration and future enablement. We want current admins who use Opportunity Contact Roles to be aware of potential changes in the surrounding object model.


### Project Resources
This issue is discussed across many ideas in the Hub: https://powerofus.force.com/s/global-search/opportunity%20contact%20roles
* Where can we find additional information on your project? Ie. do you have supporting code in another Repo, do you have documentation in Google, your repo's Wiki, etc.? Be sure to include (or at least links to) all supporting material here. If it's not in your project Repo, it will get lost.

### Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team accomplished during the Sprint?

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
