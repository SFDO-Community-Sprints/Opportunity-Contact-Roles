### Project Vision

The Opportunity Contact Roles team is concerned with planning for the future of Opportunity Contact Roles now that they're a full object. We seek to share knowledge about the current (new and improved) state of the object, and next steps for migration and future enablement. We want current admins who use Opportunity Contact Roles to be aware of potential changes in the surrounding object model.


### Project Resources
This issue is discussed across many ideas in the Hub: https://powerofus.force.com/s/global-search/opportunity%20contact%20roles
* Where can we find additional information on your project? Ie. do you have supporting code in another Repo, do you have documentation in Google, your repo's Wiki, etc.? Be sure to include (or at least links to) all supporting material here. If it's not in your project Repo, it will get lost.

### Project Team Accomplishments
* We talked through the totality of features that might be affected by the change to opportunity contact roles.
Features to be Reviewed

* Partial Soft Credits
   * Matching gifts’ use of PSC
   * Workplace giving with PSC
   * Can’t have more than one per contact 
* Affiliations and relationships that autocreate, potentially with a percent
* Account soft credits (we’re not going to cover this right now)
* NPSP Matched and Tributes
* Rollup Engine
* Household Member soft crediting (stays the same, although the code could use a refresh
* BGE - soft credits (and its underlying code)
* Soft Credits to GAUs - do they go to the opportunity?
   * Reporting Contacts to GAUs
   * Campaign would maybe also be good -- add the soft-credited folks to the campaign automatically
   * Lookup GAU 
* Healthcheck everything for OCRs
* Reports that actually work with the new world
* Rollup to Primary checkbox
* Tributes (multiples--how would that work?)
* Custom object for Tributes to lookup
* Single-screen gift-entry
* Data migration
* Customization and Integration
* Manage Soft Credits UI
* Enablement (literally checking a box to enable the functionality plus instructions)
* Validation of hard vs. soft -- hard can’t total more than 100%, but soft can be whatever.


### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
We would like to see a blog post of what to expect with OCRs come out of SFDO.
